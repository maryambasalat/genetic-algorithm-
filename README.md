# genetic-algorithm-
The genetic algorithm works on the evolutionary generational cycle to generate high-
quality solutions. These algorithms use different operations that either enhance or replace

the population to give an improved fit solution.
It basically involves five phases to solve the complex optimization problems, which are
given as below:
o Initialization
o Fitness Assignment
o Selection
o Reproduction
o Termination
